The “best” tool depends on your specific requirements, team expertise, and infrastructure. Below is a comparison to help you decide: Ease of UseAnsible:Uses YAML for playbooks, which are easy to read and write.Agentless architecture (uses SSH), so no additional software is required on the managed nodes.Great for beginners due to its simplicity and straightforward syntax.Salt:Uses YAML for states but also has its own DSL (Domain Specific Language) for more complex configurations.Requires a Salt Minion (agent) on each managed node, which adds some setup complexity.Steeper learning curve compared to Ansible, but more flexible for advanced use cases.Winner: Ansible (for simplicity and ease of adoption). PerformanceAnsible:Since it’s agentless, it can be slower for large-scale deployments because it relies on SSH for communication.Performance can be improved using techniques like pipelining or ansible-pull.Salt:Uses a message bus (ZeroMQ) for communication, which is faster and more efficient for larger environments.Better suited for real-time operations and high-performance requirements.Winner: Salt (for speed and scalability). ScalabilityAnsible:Works well for small to medium-sized environments (like 30-50 servers).Can scale to larger environments with proper tuning and tools like Ansible Tower/AWX.Salt:Designed for scalability and can handle thousands of nodes efficiently.Built-in features like syndic masters and multi-master setups make it ideal for large infrastructures.Winner: Salt (for larger or growing environments). Flexibility and FeaturesAnsible:Strong focus on simplicity and ease of use.Large collection of modules and a vibrant community.Great for ad-hoc tasks and playbook-based automation.Salt:More flexible and powerful, with features like event-driven automation, remote execution, and complex state management.Better for environments requiring real-time monitoring and reactive automation.Winner: Salt (for advanced features and flexibility). Community and EcosystemAnsible:Larger community and more third-party integrations.Extensive documentation and a vast library of roles on Ansible Galaxy.Salt:Smaller but active community.Good documentation and a growing ecosystem of formulas.Winner: Ansible (for community support and resources). SecurityAnsible:Relies on SSH, which is well-understood and secure.No additional ports or services required on managed nodes.Salt:Uses ZeroMQ and requires the Salt Minion, which introduces additional attack surfaces.Supports encryption and secure communication, but requires proper configuration.Winner: Ansible (for simplicity and reduced attack surface). Use Case SuitabilityAnsible:Ideal for environments where simplicity and ease of use are priorities.Great for teams with limited DevOps experience or smaller infrastructures.Salt:Better for environments requiring high performance, scalability, and advanced automation.Suitable for teams with more experience in configuration management.Recommendation for 30-50 ServersIf your team values simplicity, ease of use, and quick setup, go with Ansible.If you need higher performance, scalability, and advanced features, or if you anticipate growing beyond 50 servers, choose Salt.Final ThoughtsFor managing 30-50 servers, Ansible is often the better choice due to its simplicity, agentless architecture, and strong community support. However, if you have specific needs for real-time automation, scalability, or advanced features, Salt might be the better fit.

Consider using environment variables or a secure vault to store your credentials.Using Environment VariablesSet environment variables in your OS:On Windows:set EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.comset EMAIL_PASS=your_passwordOn macOS/Linux:export EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.comexport EMAIL_PASS=your_passwordModify the script to use these variables:import ossender_email = os.getenv(‘EMAIL_USER’)sender_password = os.getenv(‘EMAIL_PASS’)Step 6: Ensure Continuous RunningFor continuous running, consider using a process manager like systemd (on Linux) or a task scheduler like Windows Task Scheduler to ensure the script runs in the background.Example with Windows Task SchedulerOpen Task Scheduler and create a new task.Set the trigger to “Daily” and specify the time.In the “Actions” tab, choose “Start a Program” and set the program/script to python and add the path to your script in the “Add arguments” field.Example with systemd on LinuxCreate a systemd service file:Create a file named daily_email_report.service in /etc/systemd/system/.[Unit]Description=Daily Email Report[Service]ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/daily_email_report.pyRestart=always[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.targetEnable and start the service:sudo systemctl enable daily_email_report.servicesudo systemctl start daily_email_report.serviceBy following these steps, you’ll have a Python script that sends daily email reports, set up to run automatically at a specified time each day." }, { "title": "Chatgpt3.5 Teach Children Use Github", "url": "/posts/ChatGPT3.5-teach-children-use-github/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2023-08-01 00:00:00 +1200", "snippet": "Imagine GitHub like a magical place where you can keep all your drawings and crafts. It’s like a big folder that lives on the computer, but it’s super special because it helps you keep track of all the changes you make to your drawings.Here’s how you can explain it:Creating Your Folder (Repository): Just like you have a special folder for your drawings, on GitHub, you make something called a “repository.” It’s like your magical folder. You give it a name, like “My Drawings.”Adding Your Drawings (Files): In your repository, you can put all your drawings. Each drawing is like a special file. You can add new drawings whenever you want.Remembering Changes (Commits): Sometimes you make changes to your drawings, like adding more colors or new shapes. When you’re happy with your changes, you can “commit” them. This is like taking a snapshot of your drawing at that moment, so you can always remember how it looked.Working with Friends (Collaboration): If your friends want to help you with your drawings, you can invite them to your magical folder. They can add their drawings too! GitHub helps everyone work together.Time Travel (Version History): GitHub is so cool because it lets you travel back in time! If you don’t like the changes you made, you can go back to the old snapshot of your drawing and start from there.Sharing Magic (Sharing Your Repository): You can show your magical folder to anyone you want, like your family or friends. They can see all your drawings and the changes you’ve made.Pull Requests (Asking for Help): If you want to show your drawings to others before putting them in your magical folder, you can make a “pull request.” It’s like asking for advice. Your friends can tell you if they like your drawings or if you should make more changes.Remember, GitHub is like a big helper for keeping your drawings safe, showing them to others, and even working with your friends. Just like you’re an artist, GitHub helps people who create computer programs work together and make amazing things!And always remember, it’s okay to ask for help from grown-ups if you’re not sure about something on GitHub. It’s like asking for help when you’re learning a new art technique!Create 7 session for using githuboutline 7 sessions to gradually introduce the basics of using GitHub to a 6-year-old.

It’ll listen on a Public IP address for SIP connections from people scanning the internet with malicious intent and log their IPs, so our real SIP softswitches know to ignore them.We’ll use GeoIP2 to lookup the location of the IP and then store that data into a MySQL database.Lastly we’ll create a routing block we can use on another Kamailio instance to verify if that the IP address of the received SIP message is not in our blacklist by searching the MySQL database for the source IP.The DatabaseIn this example I’m going to create a database called “blacklist” with one table called “baddies”, in MySQL I’ll run:CREATE database blacklist;CREATE TABLE `baddies` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, `ip_address` INT unsigned UNIQUE, `hits` INT, `last_seen` DATETIME, `ua` TEXT, `country` TEXT, `city` TEXT);I’ll setup a MySQL user to INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT data from the MySQL database.For storing IP addresses in the database we’ll store them as unsigned integers, and then use the INET_ATON(‘127.0.0.1’) MySQL command to encode them from dotted-decimal format, and the INET_NTOA(‘2130706433’) to put them back into dotted decimal.ModparamsNow we’ll need to configure Kamailio, I’ll continue on from where we left off in the last post on GeoIP2 as we’ll use that to put Geographic data about the IP before adding the MySQL and SQLOps modules:# ----- SQL params -----loadmodule &quot;db_mysql.so&quot;loadmodule &quot;sqlops.so&quot;#Create a new MySQL database connection called blacklist_db modparam(&quot;sqlops&quot;,&quot;sqlcon&quot;,&quot;blacklist_db=&amp;gt;mysql://root:yourpassword@localhost/blacklist&quot;) #Set timeouts for MySQL Connectionsmodparam(&quot;db_mysql&quot;, &quot;ping_interval&quot;, 60)modparam(&quot;db_mysql&quot;, &quot;auto_reconnect&quot;, 1)modparam(&quot;db_mysql&quot;, &quot;timeout_interval&quot;, 2)After loading db_mysql and sqlops we create a new object / connection called blacklist_db with our MySQL Database parameters.Now after a restart we’ll be connected to our MySQL database.Honeypot Routing LogicNow we’ll create a route to log the traffic:####### Routing Logic ########/* Main SIP request routing logic * - processing of any incoming SIP request starts with this route * - note: this is the same as route { ... } */request_route { route(AddToBlacklist); sl_reply(&#39;200&#39;, &#39;Sure thing boss!&#39;);}route[AddToBlacklist]{ xlog(&quot;Packet received from IP $si&quot;); sql_xquery(&quot;blacklist_db&quot;, &quot;insert into baddies (ip_address, hits, last_seen, ua, country, city) values (2130706433, 10, NOW(), &#39;testua2&#39;, &#39;Australia&#39;, &#39;Hobart&#39;);&quot;);}Now for each SIP message received a new record will be inserted into the database: root@ip-172-31-8-156:/etc/kamailio# mysql -u root -p blacklist -e &quot;select * from baddies;&quot; Enter password: +----+------------+------+---------------------+---------+-----------+--------+ | id | ip_address | hits | last_seen | ua | country | city | +----+------------+------+---------------------+---------+-----------+--------+ | 1 | 2130706433 | 10 | 2019-08-13 02:52:57 | testua2 | Australia | Hobart | | 2 | 2130706433 | 10 | 2019-08-13 02:53:01 | testua2 | Australia | Hobart | | 3 | 2130706433 | 10 | 2019-08-13 02:53:05 | testua2 | Australia | Hobart | +----+------------+------+---------------------+---------+-----------+--------+This is great but we’re not actually putting the call variables in here, and we’ve got a lot of duplicates, let’s modify our sql_xquery() to include the call variables:sql_xquery(“blacklist_db”, “insert into baddies (ip_address, hits, last_seen, ua, country, city) values (INET_ATON(‘$si’), 10, NOW(), ‘$ua’, ‘Australia’, ‘Hobart’);”);Now we’re setting the IP Address value to the Source IP psedovariable ($si) and formatting it using the INET_ATON function in MySQL, setting the last_seen to the current timestamp and setting the user agent to the User Agent psedovariable ($ua).Let’s restart Kamailio, truncate the data that’s currently in the DB, send some SIP traffic to it and then check the contents:mysql -u root -p blacklist -e “select *, INET_NTOA(ip_address) from baddies;”Here you can see we’re starting to get somewhere, the IP, UA and last_seen values are all now correct.We’re getting multiple entries from the same IP though, instead we just want to increment the hits counter and set the last_seen to the current time, for that we’ll just update the SQL query to set the time to be NOW() and if that IP is already in the database to update the last_seen value and incriment the hits counter:sql_xquery(“blacklist_db”, “insert into baddies (ip_address, hits, last_seen, ua, country, city) values (INET_ATON(‘$si’), 1, NOW(), ‘$ua’, ‘Australia’, ‘Hobart’) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE last_seen = NOW(), hits = hits + 1;”);Now we’ve only got one line per IP address, with the hit counters showing how many SIP requests we’ve received from that IP.Finally we’ll use the GeoIP2 Module to get the geographic info of the source of the traffic, like we’ve talked about in the previous post:route[AddToBlacklist]{ xlog(&quot;Packet received from IP $si&quot;); geoip2_match(&quot;$si&quot;, &quot;src&quot;)) sql_xquery(&quot;blacklist_db&quot;, &quot;insert into baddies (ip_address, hits, last_seen, ua, country, city) values (INET_ATON(&#39;$si&#39;), 1, NOW(), &#39;$ua&#39;, &#39;$gip2(src=&amp;gt;cc)&#39;, &#39;$gip2(src=&amp;gt;city)&#39;) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE last_seen = NOW(), hits = hits + 1;&quot;, &quot;r_sql&quot;);}The only issue with this is if GeoIP2 doesn’t have a match, no record will be added in the database, so we’ll add a handler for that:route[AddToBlacklist]{ xlog(&quot;Packet received from IP $si&quot;); if(geoip2_match(&quot;$si&quot;, &quot;src&quot;)){ sql_xquery(&quot;blacklist_db&quot;, &quot;insert into baddies (ip_address, hits, last_seen, ua, country, city) values (INET_ATON(&#39;$si&#39;), 1, NOW(), &#39;$ua&#39;, &#39;$gip2(src=&amp;gt;cc)&#39;, &#39;$gip2(src=&amp;gt;city)&#39;) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE last_seen = NOW(), hits = hits + 1;&quot;, &quot;r_sql&quot;); }else{ ##If no match in GeoIP2 leave Country &amp;amp; City fields blank sql_xquery(&quot;blacklist_db&quot;, &quot;insert into baddies (ip_address, hits, last_seen, ua, country, city) values (INET_ATON(&#39;$si&#39;), 1, NOW(), &#39;$ua&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE last_seen = NOW(), hits = hits + 1;&quot;, &quot;r_sql&quot;); }}Now let’s check our database again and see how the data looks:mysql -u root -p blacklist -e &quot;select *, INET_NTOA(ip_address) from baddies;&quot; Perfect! Now we’re inserting data into our blacklist from our honeypot. Now we’ll configure a new routing block we can use on another Kamailio instance to see if an IP is in the blacklist.I left this running on my AWS box for a few hours, and lots of dodgy UAs dropped in to say hello, one of which was very insistent on making calls to Poland…Querying the DataNow we’ve got a blacklist it’s only useful if we block the traffic from our malicous actors who we’ve profiled in the database.You could feed this into BGP to null route the traffic, or hook this into your firewall’s API, but we’re going to do this in Kamailio, so we’ll create a new routing block we can use on a different Kamailio instance – Like a production one – to see if the IP it just received traffic from is in the blacklist.We’ve already spoken about querying databases in the SQLops Kamailio bytes, but this routing block will query the blacklist database, and if the sender is in the database, one or more records will be returned, so we know they’re bad and will drop their traffic:route[CheckBlacklist]{ xlog(&quot;Checking blacklist for ip $si&quot;); #Define a variable containing the SQL query we&#39;ll run $var(sql) = &quot;select INET_NTOA(ip_address) as ip_address from baddies;&quot;; #Log the SQL query we&#39;re going to run to syslog for easy debugging xlog(&quot;Query to run is $var(sql)&quot;); #Query blacklist_db running the query stored in $var(sql) and store the result of the query to result_sql sql_query(&quot;blacklist_db&quot;, &quot;$var(sql)&quot;, &quot;result_sql&quot;); #If more than 0 records were returned from the database, drop the traffic if($dbr(result_sql=&amp;gt;rows)&amp;gt;0){ xlog(&quot;This guy is bad news. Dropping traffic from $si&quot;); exit; }else{ xlog(&quot;No criminal record for $si - Allowing to progress&quot;); }}RecapWe’d previously touched on using the GeoIP2 module to lookup the location of IP Addresses and SQLops and db_mysql to work with relational databases from within Kamailio.This Honeypot use case just put those elements together.In reality a far better implementation of this would use HTable to store this data, but hopefully this gives you a better understanding of how to actually work with data." }, { "title": "KAZOO 4.X SUP CMD", "url": "/posts/kazoo-sup-cmd/", "categories":

Code Table0–UNSPECIFIED-Unspecified. No other cause codes applicable.-This is usually given by the router when none of the other codes apply. This cause usually occurs in the same type of situations as cause 1, cause 88, and cause 100.1-404-UNALLOCATED_NUMBER-Unallocated (unassigned) number [Q.850 value 1]-This cause indicates that the called party cannot be reached because, although the called party number is in a valid format, it is not currently allocated (assigned).2-404-NO_ROUTE_TRANSIT_NET-No route to specified transit network (national use) [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a request to route the call through a particular transit network, which it does not recognize. The equipment sending this cause does not recognize the transit network either because the transit network does not exist or because that particular transit network, while it does exist, does not serve the equipment which is sending this cause.3-404-NO_ROUTE_DESTINATION-No route to destination [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the called party cannot be reached because the network through which the call has been routed does not serve the destination desired. This cause is supported on a network dependent basis.6–CHANNEL_UNACCEPTABLE-channel unacceptable [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the channel most recently identified is not acceptable to the sending entity for use in this call.7–CALL_AWARDED_DELIVERED-call awarded, being delivered in an established channel [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the user has been awarded the incoming call, and that the incoming call is being connected to a channel already established to that user for similar calls (e.g. packet-mode x.25 virtual calls).16–NORMAL_CLEARING-normal call clearing [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the call is being cleared because one of the users involved in the call has requested that the call be cleared. Under normal situations, the source of this cause is not the network.17-486-USER_BUSY-user busy [Q.850]-This cause is used to indicate that the called party is unable to accept another call because the user busy condition has been encountered. This cause value may be generated by the called user or by the network. In the case of user determined user busy it is noted that the user equipment is compatible with the call.18-408-NO_USER_RESPONSE-no user responding [Q.850]-This cause is used when a called party does not respond to a call establishment message with either an alerting or connect indication within the prescribed period of time allocated.19-480-NO_ANSWER-no answer from user (user alerted) [Q.850]-This cause is used when the called party has been alerted but does not respond with a connect indication within a prescribed period of time. Note - This cause is not necessarily generated by Q.931 procedures but may be generated by internal network timers.20-480-SUBSCRIBER_ABSENT-subscriber absent [Q.850]-This cause value is used when a mobile station has logged off, radio contact is not obtained with a mobile station or if a personal telecommunication user is temporarily not addressable at any user-network interface. Sofia SIP will normally raise USER_NOT_REGISTERED in such situations.21-603-CALL_REJECTED-call rejected [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause does not wish to accept this call, although it could have accepted the call because the equipment sending this cause is neither busy nor incompatible. The network may also generate this cause, indicating that the call was cleared due to a supplementary service constraint. The diagnostic field may contain additional information about the supplementary service and reason for rejection.22-410-NUMBER_CHANGED-number changed [Q.850]-This cause is returned to a calling party when the called party number indicated by the calling party is no longer assigned, The new called party number may optionally be included in the diagnostic field. If a network does not support this cause, cause no: 1, unallocated (unassigned) number shall be used.23-410-REDIRECTION_TO_NEW_DESTINATION–This cause is used by a general ISUP protocol mechanism that can be invoked by an exchange that decides that the call should be set-up to a different called number. Such an exchange can invoke a redirection mechanism, by use of this cause value, to request a preceding exchange involved in the call to route the call to the new number.25-483-EXCHANGE_ROUTING_ERROR–This cause indicates that the destination indicated by the user cannot be reached, because an intermediate exchange has released the call due to reaching a limit in executing the hop counter procedure. This cause is generated by an intermediate node, which when decrementing the hop counter value, gives the result 0.27-502-DESTINATION_OUT_OF_ORDER-destination out of order [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the destination indicated by the user cannot be reached because the interface to the destination is not functioning correctly. The term “not functioning correctly” indicates that a signal message was unable to be delivered to the remote party; e.g. a physical layer or data link layer failure at the remote party, or user equipment off-line.28-484-INVALID_NUMBER_FORMAT-invalid number format (address incomplete) [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the called party cannot be reached because the called party number is not in a valid format or is not complete.29-501-FACILITY_REJECTED-facilities rejected [Q.850]-This cause is returned when a supplementary service requested by the user cannot be provide by the network.30–RESPONSE_TO_STATUS_ENQUIRY-response to STATUS INQUIRY [Q.850]-This cause is included in the STATUS message when the reason for generating the STATUS message was the prior receipt of a STATUS INQUIRY.31-480-NORMAL_UNSPECIFIED-normal, unspecified [Q.850]-This cause is used to report a normal event only when no other cause in the normal class applies.34-503-NORMAL_CIRCUIT_CONGESTION-no circuit/channel available [Q.850]-This cause indicates that there is no appropriate circuit/channel presently available to handle the call.38-502-NETWORK_OUT_OF_ORDER-network out of order [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the network is not functioning correctly and that the condition is likely to last a relatively long period of time e.g. immediately re-attempting the call is not likely to be successful.41-503-NORMAL_TEMPORARY_FAILURE-temporary failure [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the network is not functioning correctly and that the condition is not likely to last a long period of time; e.g. the user may wish to try another call attempt almost immediately.42-503-SWITCH_CONGESTION-switching equipment congestion [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the switching equipment generating this cause is experiencing a period of high traffic.43–ACCESS_INFO_DISCARDED-access information discarded [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the network could not deliver access information to the remote user as requested, i.e. user-to-user information, low layer compatibility, high layer compatibility or sub-address as indicated in the diagnostic. It is noted that the particular type of access information discarded is optionally included in the diagnostic.44-503-REQUESTED_CHAN_UNAVAIL-requested circuit/channel not available [Q.850]-This cause is returned when the other side of the interface cannot provide the circuit or channel indicated by the requesting entity.45–PRE_EMPTED–47–resource unavailable, unspecified [Q.850]-This cause is used to report a resource unavailable event only when no other cause in the resource unavailable class applies.50–FACILITY_NOT_SUBSCRIBED-requested facility not subscribed [Q.850-This cause indicates that the user has requested a supplementary service, which is available, but the user is not authorized to use.52-403-OUTGOING_CALL_BARRED-outgoing calls barred-This cause indicates that although the calling party is a member of the CUG for the outgoing CUG call, outgoing calls are not allowed for this member of the CUG.54-403-INCOMING_CALL_BARRED-incoming calls barred-This cause indicates that although the called party is a member of the CUG for the incoming CUG call, incoming calls are not allowed to this member of the CUG.57-403-BEARERCAPABILITY_NOTAUTH-bearer capability not authorized [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the user has requested a bearer capability that is implemented by the equipment which generated this cause but the user is not authorized to use.58-503-BEARERCAPABILITY_NOTAVAIL-bearer capability not presently available [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the user has requested a bearer capability which is implemented by the equipment which generated this cause but which is not available at this time.63–SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE-service or option not available, unspecified [Q.850]-This cause is used to report a service or option not available event only when no other cause in the service or option not available class applies.65-488-BEARERCAPABILITY_NOTIMPL-bearer capability not implemented [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause does not support the bearer capability requested.66–CHAN_NOT_IMPLEMENTED-channel type not implemented [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause does not support the channel type requested69-501-FACILITY_NOT_IMPLEMENTED-requested facility not implemented [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause does not support the requested supplementary services.79-501-SERVICE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED-service or option not implemented, unspecified [Q.850]-This cause is used to report a service or option not implemented event only when no other cause in the service or option not implemented class applies.81–INVALID_CALL_REFERENCE-invalid call reference value [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message with a call reference which is not currently in use on the user-network interface.88-488-INCOMPATIBLE_DESTINATION-incompatible destination [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a request to establish a call which has low layer compatibility, high layer compatibility or other compatibility attributes (e.g. data rate) which cannot be accommodated.95–INVALID_MSG_UNSPECIFIED-invalid message, unspecified [Q.850]-This cause is used to report an invalid message event only when no other cause in the invalid message class applies.96–MANDATORY_IE_MISSING-mandatory information element is missing [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message which is missing an information element which must be present in the message before that message can be processed.97–MESSAGE_TYPE_NONEXIST-message type non-existent or not implemented [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message with a message type it does not recognize either because this is a message not defined of defined but not implemented by the equipment sending this cause.98–WRONG_MESSAGE-message not compatible with call state or message type non-existent or not implemented. [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message such that the procedures do not indicate that this is a permissible message to receive while in the call state, or a STATUS message was received indicating an incompatible call state.99–IE_NONEXIST-Information element / parameter non-existent or not implemented [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message which includes information element(s)/parameter(s) not recognized because the information element(s)/parameter name(s) are not defined or are defined but not implemented by the equipment sending the cause. This cause indicates that the information element(s)/parameter(s) were discarded. However, the information element is not required to be present in the message in order for the equipment sending the cause to process the message.100–INVALID_IE_CONTENTS-Invalid information element contents [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received and information element which it has implemented; however, one or more fields in the I.E. are coded in such a way which has not been implemented by the equipment sending this cause.101–WRONG_CALL_STATE-message not compatible with call state [Q.850]-This cause indicates that a message has been received which is incompatible with the call state.102-504-RECOVERY_ON_TIMER_EXPIRE-recovery on timer expiry [Q.850]-This cause indicates that a procedure has been initiated by the expiration of a timer in association with error handling procedures. This is often associated with NAT problems. Ensure that “NAT Mapping Enable” is turned on in your ATA. If it is not NAT related it can sometimes be provider related, make sure to ensure another outbound provider does not solve the problem.FreeSWITCH also returns this when the remote party sends a 408 for call expired.103–MANDATORY_IE_LENGTH_ERROR-parameter non-existent or not implemented - passed on (national use) [Q.850]-This cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message which includes parameters not recognized because the parameters are not defined or are defined but not implemented by the equipment sending this cause. The cause indicates that the parameter(s) were ignored. In addition, if the equipment sending this cause is an intermediate point, then this cause indicates that the parameter(s) were passed unchanged.111–PROTOCOL_ERROR-protocol error, unspecified [Q.850]-This cause is used to report a protocol error event only when no other cause in the protocol error class applies.127–INTERWORKING-Interworking, unspecified [Q.850]-This cause indicates that an interworking call (usually a call to SW56 service) has ended.487-487-ORIGINATOR_CANCEL–500–CRASH–501–SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN–502–LOSE_RACE–503–MANAGER_REQUEST–This cause is used when you send an api command to make it hangup. For example uuid_kill 600–BLIND_TRANSFER–601–ATTENDED_TRANSFER–602–ALLOTTED_TIMEOUT–This cause means that the server canceled the call because the destination channel took too long to answer.603–USER_CHALLENGE–604–MEDIA_TIMEOUT–605–PICKED_OFF–This cause means the call was picked up by intercepting it from another extension (i.e. dialing **ext_number from another extension).606–USER_NOT_REGISTERED–This means you tried to originate a call to a SIP user who forgot to register.607–PROGRESS_TIMEOUT–See: progress_timeout609–GATEWAY_DOWN–Gateway is down (not answering on OPTIONS or SUBSCRIBE)SIP to Q.850 Code Table400-41-NORMAL_TEMPORARY_FAILURE-Temporary failure [Q.850]401-21-CALL_REJECTED-Call rejected [Q.850]402-21-CALL_REJECTED-Call rejected [Q.850]403-21-CALL_REJECTED-Call rejected [Q.850]404-1-NO_ROUTE_TRANSIT_NET-Unallocated number [Q.850]" }, { "title": "The First One", "url": "/posts/the-first-one/", "categories": "web", "tags": "github", "date": "2021-11-09 14:10:00 +1300", "snippet": "A New Post from ycEnter text in Markdown.

Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- Note: The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of dateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsSimilar to TOC, the Disqus comments are loaded by default in each post, and the global switch is defined by variable comments in file _config.yml . If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesPreview imageIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the attribute src, width, height, and alt for the image:---image: src: /path/to/image/file width: 1000 # in pixels height: 400 # in pixels alt: image alternative text---Except for alt, all other options are necessary, especially the width and height, which are related to user experience and web page loading performance. Later section “Image size” will also mention this.Image captionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_Image sizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; }Image positionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right. For example: Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } Limitation: Once the position of the image is specified, the image caption should not be added.Image shadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect, and the shadow will be visible in the light mode:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&amp;lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png&quot; alt=&quot;The flower&quot;&amp;gt;Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:This is a plaintext code snippet.Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value``` Limitation: The Jekyll style highlight tag is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of the code block, you can append {: .nolineno} at the next line:```shellecho &#39;No more line numbers!&#39;```{: .nolineno}Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed on the left side of the header of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=&quot;path/to/file&quot; }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains &#39;Pack&#39; %} This product&#39;s title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false" } ]
