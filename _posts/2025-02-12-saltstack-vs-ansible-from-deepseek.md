Both SaltStack (now often referred to as Salt) and Ansible are powerful configuration management and orchestration tools, and either can be a good choice for managing 30-50 servers. The "best" tool depends on your specific requirements, team expertise, and infrastructure. Below is a comparison to help you decide:

1. Ease of Use
Ansible:

Uses YAML for playbooks, which are easy to read and write.

Agentless architecture (uses SSH), so no additional software is required on the managed nodes.

Great for beginners due to its simplicity and straightforward syntax.

Salt:

Uses YAML for states but also has its own DSL (Domain Specific Language) for more complex configurations.

Requires a Salt Minion (agent) on each managed node, which adds some setup complexity.

Steeper learning curve compared to Ansible, but more flexible for advanced use cases.

Winner: Ansible (for simplicity and ease of adoption).

2. Performance
Ansible:

Since it’s agentless, it can be slower for large-scale deployments because it relies on SSH for communication.

Performance can be improved using techniques like pipelining or ansible-pull.

Salt:

Uses a message bus (ZeroMQ) for communication, which is faster and more efficient for larger environments.

Better suited for real-time operations and high-performance requirements.

Winner: Salt (for speed and scalability).

3. Scalability
Ansible:

Works well for small to medium-sized environments (like 30-50 servers).

Can scale to larger environments with proper tuning and tools like Ansible Tower/AWX.

Salt:

Designed for scalability and can handle thousands of nodes efficiently.

Built-in features like syndic masters and multi-master setups make it ideal for large infrastructures.

Winner: Salt (for larger or growing environments).

4. Flexibility and Features
Ansible:

Strong focus on simplicity and ease of use.

Large collection of modules and a vibrant community.

Great for ad-hoc tasks and playbook-based automation.

Salt:

More flexible and powerful, with features like event-driven automation, remote execution, and complex state management.

Better for environments requiring real-time monitoring and reactive automation.

Winner: Salt (for advanced features and flexibility).

5. Community and Ecosystem
Ansible:

Larger community and more third-party integrations.

Extensive documentation and a vast library of roles on Ansible Galaxy.

Salt:

Smaller but active community.

Good documentation and a growing ecosystem of formulas.

Winner: Ansible (for community support and resources).

6. Security
Ansible:

Relies on SSH, which is well-understood and secure.

No additional ports or services required on managed nodes.

Salt:

Uses ZeroMQ and requires the Salt Minion, which introduces additional attack surfaces.

Supports encryption and secure communication, but requires proper configuration.

Winner: Ansible (for simplicity and reduced attack surface).

7. Use Case Suitability
Ansible:

Ideal for environments where simplicity and ease of use are priorities.

Great for teams with limited DevOps experience or smaller infrastructures.

Salt:

Better for environments requiring high performance, scalability, and advanced automation.

Suitable for teams with more experience in configuration management.

Recommendation for 30-50 Servers
If your team values simplicity, ease of use, and quick setup, go with Ansible.

If you need higher performance, scalability, and advanced features, or if you anticipate growing beyond 50 servers, choose Salt.

Final Thoughts
For managing 30-50 servers, Ansible is often the better choice due to its simplicity, agentless architecture, and strong community support. However, if you have specific needs for real-time automation, scalability, or advanced features, Salt might be the better fit. Evaluate your team’s expertise and long-term goals before making a decision.
