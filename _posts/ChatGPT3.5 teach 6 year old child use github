Imagine GitHub like a magical place where you can keep all your drawings and crafts. It's like a big folder that lives on the computer, but it's super special because it helps you keep track of all the changes you make to your drawings.

Here's how you can explain it:

Creating Your Folder (Repository): Just like you have a special folder for your drawings, on GitHub, you make something called a "repository." It's like your magical folder. You give it a name, like "My Drawings."

Adding Your Drawings (Files): In your repository, you can put all your drawings. Each drawing is like a special file. You can add new drawings whenever you want.

Remembering Changes (Commits): Sometimes you make changes to your drawings, like adding more colors or new shapes. When you're happy with your changes, you can "commit" them. This is like taking a snapshot of your drawing at that moment, so you can always remember how it looked.

Working with Friends (Collaboration): If your friends want to help you with your drawings, you can invite them to your magical folder. They can add their drawings too! GitHub helps everyone work together.

Time Travel (Version History): GitHub is so cool because it lets you travel back in time! If you don't like the changes you made, you can go back to the old snapshot of your drawing and start from there.

Sharing Magic (Sharing Your Repository): You can show your magical folder to anyone you want, like your family or friends. They can see all your drawings and the changes you've made.

Pull Requests (Asking for Help): If you want to show your drawings to others before putting them in your magical folder, you can make a "pull request." It's like asking for advice. Your friends can tell you if they like your drawings or if you should make more changes.

Remember, GitHub is like a big helper for keeping your drawings safe, showing them to others, and even working with your friends. Just like you're an artist, GitHub helps people who create computer programs work together and make amazing things!

And always remember, it's okay to ask for help from grown-ups if you're not sure about something on GitHub. It's like asking for help when you're learning a new art technique!
